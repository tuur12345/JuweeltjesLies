        Welcome to Juweeltjes Lies! I'm Lies, a passionate jewelry designer dedicated to creating unique, 
        handcrafted pieces that tell a story. Each piece in my collection is carefully crafted with love 
        and attention to detail.

        My journey in jewelry making began over a decade ago, inspired by the beauty of natural materials 
        and the joy of creating something special for each customer. I believe that jewelry should be more 
        than just an accessory â€“ it should be a personal expression of who you are.
